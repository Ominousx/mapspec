# 🧠 Map Confidence Spectrum (Wolves POV CLI Tool)

This is a simple CLI tool that helps Valorant analysts visualize **map matchup confidence** between their team and an upcoming opponent — from their team's point of view.

It outputs a **7-box color spectrum** showing which maps are weak (red), neutral (white), and strong (green) for your team based on the upcoming opponent.

## 📁 CSV Format

Each team’s CSV should look like this:

| Map      | Picks | Bans | Wins | Losses |
|----------|-------|------|------|--------|
| Pearl    | 3     | 1    | 3    | 0      |
| Haven    | 2     | 0    | 2    | 0      |
| Icebox   | 2     | 1    | 1    | 1      |
| Split    | 0     | 2    | 0    | 0      |
| Fracture | 1     | 2    | 0    | 1      |
| Lotus    | 2     | 0    | 2    | 0      |
| Ascent   | 1     | 3    | 0    | 1      |

- Map names must match exactly: Pearl, Haven, Icebox, Split, Fracture, Lotus, Ascent
- Win rate, picks, and bans are used to calculate the confidence score

## 🎨 Output

A horizontal bar showing 7 maps:
- Red = low confidence
- White = even/neutral
- Green = high confidence

Output is saved as a `.png` file (default: `map_confidence_spectrum.png`)

## 🤝 Reusable for Any Team

Just set `--wolves` to your own team file. The confidence spectrum will always reflect your POV.
